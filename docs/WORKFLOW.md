# DevByAlex — the workflow

An autonomous, stage-gated pipeline that takes an app from a one-line idea to
launch-ready. Three macro stages — **plan**, **dev**, **launch** — with human
approval gates between plan and dev, and before the `staging → main` promotion to
production. Staging itself deploys automatically via Pipeline by Alex on push to
`staging` (`main` = protected production).
`init-ai` brings any repo (blank or existing) under the workflow; `docs/STATUS.md`
is the live control file every skill reads and writes.

## The pieces this plugin ships

### Skills (the stages)

| Skill | Stage | Does |
|-------|-------|------|
| `init-ai` | entry | Bootstraps/integrates the workflow into a repo; reconciles STATUS from what's already done. |
| `plan-spec` | plan | Interviews to a complete spec; `reverse` mode backfills from code. |
| `plan-guide` | plan | Expands the spec into a granular, ordered guide + feature cards + per-feature ADRs (`adr-backfill` mode writes the missing ADRs for an existing repo's features). |
| `plan-design` | plan | Picks the app's named visual style — PRIMARY (structure, 1 of 12 product directions) × SECONDARY (feeling, 1 of 50 named styles from `knowledge/design/design-styles.md`) — then **web-searches 3–5 real-world references** of the confirmed style (live products/galleries) to seed the tokens, and records pick + references + reason in `docs/DESIGN.md` before wireframes. `restyle` mode re-picks for an existing app, records the supersession, and hands off to `uiux-redesign` to apply it. |
| `uiux-redesign` | plan/dev | The application half of a `restyle` — sweeps a confirmed new style across an existing app's every customer-facing screen: rewrites the `docs/DESIGN.md` token system, then conforms the diverging surfaces (web + mobile) via token/shared-component changes, **leaving already-aligned surfaces alone** (change is justified by divergence, not by the sweep). Runs as code change through the validate loop, re-verifies WCAG 2.2 AA, and routes regressions to an `RSTY-xxx` queue → `fix-errors`. Owns the rollout, not the taste call. |
| `plan-wireframes` | plan | Wireframe each feature — GENERATE via Figma MCP (greenfield) or CAPTURE existing screens from code (existing app, no Figma). Reads the committed style from `docs/DESIGN.md`. |
| `dev-scaffold` | dev | One-time baseline: monorepo topology (`marketing/` apex + `web/` full-stack app on app.domain + optional `app/` mobile), branch model (protected `main` = production, `staging` = working line), skeleton, tooling, tests, and CI + deploy via Pipeline by Alex (`pba.yml` + thin caller). |
| `dev-auth` | dev | Authentication first, security & privacy prioritized. Validate-existing mode audits + hardens auth an existing repo already has. |
| `feature-loop` | dev | The per-feature 4-step build/validate engine. |
| `dev-autopilot` | dev | Advances the build one safe step per run (what a schedule calls). |
| `dev-update` | dev/ops | Re-vendors the latest DevByAlex skills/agents/templates into the current app (`install.sh --update`); the manual update path that keeps the local committed copies current. |
| `dev-schedule` | dev/ops | Sets up the unattended schedule that calls `dev-autopilot` off an explicitly named working branch; the committed `.claude/` is self-sufficient, so the runner needs nothing extra (a GitHub-Actions runner needs only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). |
| `launch-acceptance` | launch | Writes the staging acceptance pass as runnable suites — Playwright (web) + Maestro (iOS/Android) — generated from a scenario doc. |
| `launch-verify` | launch | Runs the `launch-acceptance` suites against the live staging environment, triages failures into an `ACC-xxx` queue → `fix-errors`, re-runs to green, and checks the "acceptance suite passed against staging" gate `launch-submit` reads. The runner half of the author/run split. |
| `launch-compliance` | launch | Legal (ToS / privacy policy / cookie consent), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), SEO, and prose scans; drives the two hard launch gates + a fix queue. Reuses `launch-readiness`, `accessibility-critique`, `seo-audit`, `prose-check`. |
| `launch-visual-qa` | launch | The cross-platform screenshot loop (build → boot → screenshot → critique → fix): boots iOS sim + Android emulator, drives the Maestro flows to capture every key screen/state, the `design-critic` agent vets them (against wireframes, `docs/DESIGN.md`, and the universal design rules) and emits a `VIS-xxx` queue → `fix-errors`, re-screenshots to confirm. Reuses the `launch-acceptance` Maestro flows + `fix-errors`. |
| `launch-store-assets` | launch | The "App Store tab," doubled: icon, device-framed screenshots (iOS sizes + Android phone/tablet), Play feature graphic, and per-field listing copy for **both** App Store Connect and Play Console, from the real running app. Reuses `create-demo`, `marketer-copywriting`, `ios-audit`. |
| `launch-submit` | launch | Dual-store delivery lane — detects Expo→EAS / bare→Fastlane, builds, and submits to **TestFlight + Play internal testing**. Gated on readiness/compliance/hard-gates; **human-triggered only**, never auto-promotes to production. Reuses `launch-readiness`, `ios-audit`. |

### Agents (the specialists the feature loop deploys)

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `feature-builder` | Owns one feature; deploys the four steps. |
| `feature-implementer` | Writes the feature code (not its tests). |
| `test-author` | Writes tests from the spec, blind to the code. |
| `feature-validator` | Runs tests + reviews feature code; reports, doesn't fix. |
| `integration-validator` | Runs full suite + reviews whole repo; reports, doesn't fix. |
| `design-critic` | Vets screenshots of design changes against `docs/DESIGN.md` (style + references), the wireframes, and the universal design rules; emits a `CRIT-xxx` queue. Design work isn't done until it passes; judges, doesn't fix. |

### Existing skills it reuses (not reinvented)

The workflow leans on skills that already exist rather than duplicating them.
These supporting skills live in `skills/` alongside the workflow stages — they're
all native to this repo now — and `install.sh` **vendors** the whole `skills/`
folder into each app's `.claude/skills` so any runner has them. Every skill is a
full copy committed into the repo — there are no live-served skills and nothing is
loaded over the network at run time. Improve one and re-vendor with
`./install.sh <app> --update` (or `/dev-update`) to refresh the committed copies.
The supporting skills (`scout`, `fix-errors`, `issue-checker`,
`test-suite-developer`, `staging-smoke-test`, `launch-readiness`, `prose-check`,
`seo-audit`, `accessibility-critique`, `ios-audit`, `create-demo`,
`marketer-brand-generation`, `marketer-copywriting`):

- `test-suite-developer` — the test-author's engine.
- `scout` — the validators' adversarial review (feature-scoped and whole-repo).
- `issue-checker` — confirms a finding is real before it's fixed.
- `fix-errors` — drives a findings queue to zero during the validation loops.
- `staging-smoke-test` — human-walkable config/integration check at launch.
- `launch-readiness` — codebase go/no-go audit at launch (incl. legal/policy).
- `prose-check` — strips AI tells from copy (plan wireframes + launch prose pass).
- `seo-audit` — code-level SEO audit at launch (needs `docs/BRAND.md`).
- `accessibility-critique` — WCAG 2.2 AA audit at launch → `A11Y-xxx` fix queue.
- `marketer-brand-generation` — writes `docs/BRAND.md` in the plan stage (seeds
  SEO + voice; required by `seo-audit`).
- `marketer-copywriting` — on-brand copy when wireframe/launch prose needs more
  than a cleanup pass; also writes the store listing copy in `launch-store-assets`.
- `ios-audit` — App Store Review / Play policy audit; used by `launch-submit`
  (rejection preflight) and `launch-store-assets` (metadata/age-rating compliance).
- `create-demo` — Maestro-driven capture of the real running app; `launch-store-assets`
  reuses it to pull real screenshots for the store listing.
- `uiux-init` / `uiux-audit` — optional external design-doc + UI alignment
  alongside wireframes: `uiux-init` expands a fresh pick into the full token
  system + component rules, and `uiux-audit` aligns screens to `docs/DESIGN.md`.
  The native `plan-design` owns the **style decision** (the named PRIMARY ×
  SECONDARY pick), and the native `uiux-redesign` owns the **rollout** — sweeping
  a confirmed new style across an existing app's screens when `plan-design
  restyle` re-picks. (`uiux-audit` is the fallback for the screen sweep if
  `uiux-redesign` isn't present.)

And it reads Alex's encoded conventions from the **vendored `knowledge/`**
(copied into `<app>/.claude/knowledge/` by `install.sh`; skills read it directly
at `../../knowledge/...`, the same idiom as `../../templates/`):
`knowledge/practices/<key>.yaml` — `project-kickoff` (spec), `auth`,
`data-modeling`, `payments`, `testing`, `code-review`, `launch-readiness`,
`uiux` — plus `knowledge/stack/*.md` and `knowledge/checklists/*.md`. Best
practices are read from these files, not fetched from a brain; decisions are
recorded in the repo — feature-scoped ones in `docs/adr/` (the governing
per-feature records), cross-cutting ones appended to `docs/DECISIONS.md` (the
chronological log). A committed checkout is fully self-sufficient — no MCP
token or network brain.

## The control file: `docs/STATUS.md`

Every skill reads it first and writes it last. It holds: the macro stage, the
approval gates (Alex-only), the plan/dev/launch checkboxes, the **feature table**
(per-feature per-step status), the single `## Next action` line `dev-autopilot`
keys off, the blockers list, and a log. Keep it short; detail lives in feature
cards and the log.

## The bug log: `docs/BUGS.md`

The human-written counterpart to STATUS. You drop bugs you hit into its `## Open`
section; `dev-autopilot` drains it **before any build step** — fixing every open
bug through its verify loop, moving each to `## Fixed`, and stopping the run there
(a bug-fix run does nothing else). Open bugs are also a **soft launch gate**: the
autopilot won't enter `/launch-acceptance` while any remain. This is the one place
the "one step per run" rule bends — the whole log drains in a single run, because
known-broken code is never a base for new work.

## The decision records: `docs/adr/`

One ADR file per feature (mirroring `docs/features/<NN>-<slug>.md`, plus
`scaffold.md` and `auth.md` for the cross-cutting stages), holding the decisions
that govern it — what it has, what it deliberately does **not** have, and why.
`docs/DECISIONS.md` stays the chronological log of *what happened when*; the ADR
is the per-feature record of *what holds now*. The contract (spelled out in the
stamped `docs/adr/README.md`):

- **Consult before change.** Every skill/agent that touches a feature reads its
  ADR first — builds, bug fixes, and validation loops alike.
- **Breaking an `active` decision requires explicit human confirmation.** The
  loop/autopilot stops and surfaces the conflict (citing the entry); on
  confirmation the old entry is marked superseded and the new decision recorded.
  Never a silent divergence.
- **Documented deliberate omissions are not findings.** The validators, `scout`,
  and `launch-readiness` cite the ADR entry instead of filing — so an automated
  review can't flag what was consciously chosen. Security/legal/accessibility
  issues still get reported (tagged `ADR-conflict`), and the two hard launch
  gates are never overridable by an ADR.
- **But the ADR blocks blind change, not criticism.** Concrete evidence that an
  `active` decision is itself causing real harm is reported as an
  `ADR-challenge` (entry + evidence, routed to the human, never the fix
  queue). Agents may argue with a decision; only Alex may change it.
- **Drift is a finding.** Code contradicting an `active` decision with no
  recorded supersession is architecture drift — the record wins until a human
  retires it.
- **Seeded at plan time, kept current by the loop.** `/plan-guide` writes each
  feature's ADR with its card; `feature-loop` step 4 records what the build
  decided. On an existing repo, `/plan-guide adr-backfill` must write an ADR for
  **every** feature — consolidating any scattered feature docs into them (or
  removing the irrelevant ones) — before feature work proceeds.

## Integrating an existing (not-yet-launch-ready) repo

`init-ai` works on a half-built repo, not just a blank one — but "finish my app"
routes through the same gates, so the path is **backfill → validate → build the
rest**:

1. **Backfill the plan from code.** No spec/guide exist, so `init-ai` routes to
   `/plan-spec reverse` (infer the spec from code, tag inferences) → `/plan-guide`.
   The wireframe gate is satisfied by `/plan-wireframes capture` — an inventory of
   the screens already in the code, **no Figma needed** — since the UI exists.
   The backfill includes the **ADRs**: every identified feature gets its
   `docs/adr/` record (inferred decisions + deliberate omissions, tagged
   `(needs review)`), with any scattered feature docs consolidated into them or
   removed — **before any feature work**, so the validators can tell a gap from
   a choice.
2. **Alex approves the three gates.** Dev stays blocked until then; an existing
   codebase doesn't bypass approval.
3. **Validate before building.** `init-ai` does **not** check off existing work as
   done: auth that exists but was never security-validated stays unchecked
   (`/dev-auth validate` audits + hardens it), and existing features are recorded
   impl-present / validation-pending. So autopilot's **first phase is
   validate-and-harden** — backfill spec-traced tests, run the validators, fix —
   re-certifying what's there before adding anything new.
4. **Then build the rest** via the normal feature loop, pushing to the working
   branch (use a dedicated iteration branch on a repo with a real `main`).

The principle: code existing is not the same as code being correct, validated, or
aligned to an approved spec — none of which can be known from the code alone. The
integration path makes that gap explicit instead of marking a working-but-unproven
app "done."

## Invariants the whole system upholds

- **Gates are human.** Agents never self-approve spec/guide/wireframes/deploy, or
  the legal-compliance / accessibility ship gates.
- **Tests trace to the spec.** Test-author and implementer run in parallel and
  blind, so tests verify behavior, not whatever the code happens to do.
- **Validators judge, they don't fix.** Separation keeps the gates honest; the
  orchestrator turns findings into failing tests + fixes.
- **ADRs govern change.** Every feature has a decision record in `docs/adr/`
  before the loop touches it; breaking an `active` decision needs explicit human
  confirmation + a recorded supersession, and documented deliberate omissions
  are never review findings (security/legal/a11y excepted — and the hard launch
  gates are never ADR-overridable).
- **One safe step per autopilot run.** Bounded, resumable, reviewable — except a
  bug-fix run, which drains all of `docs/BUGS.md` before any build step resumes.
- **Bugs before building.** Open bugs in `docs/BUGS.md` preempt scaffold/auth/
  feature work and block entry to the launch stage until fixed.
- **Green suite at every stop; push straight to the working branch.** Nothing
  marked done with red tests or open findings. To keep iteration fast the dev
  stage commits and pushes to one working branch — no per-step branches, no PR
  pile-up. Green suite is the gate, not a human merge. Interactive runs use the
  current branch; a cron names the branch explicitly. Use a dedicated iteration
  branch (e.g. `staging`/`autopilot`), not a protected default.
- **Nothing is left orphaned.** Every run cleans up after itself: artifacts its
  work superseded or left unreferenced — scratch/debug scripts, temp files,
  dead code and unused exports/deps, components/assets/tokens nothing renders,
  stale fixtures, superseded docs — are removed in the same run, not left to
  rot. Two carve-outs: anything **explicitly recorded as kept** (ADR /
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`) is not an orphan; and an orphan that is **substantial
  work** (a part-built feature, a whole module, real content) is never
  silently deleted — it's surfaced to Alex as a keep-or-remove question, and a
  "keep" gets recorded so the next sweep doesn't re-flag it. `init-ai`
  inventories pre-existing orphans on integration and queues them as
  `[orphan]` bugs.
- **Security & privacy beat convenience**, most of all in auth.
- **Legal & accessibility are hard launch gates.** Terms of Service, a privacy
  policy accurate to real data flows, a web cookie-consent banner, and WCAG 2.2 AA
  conformance are designed for in the plan and verified by `/launch-compliance`
  before ship — no launch with either gate open.

See `docs/SCHEDULING.md` for running the dev stage unattended.
